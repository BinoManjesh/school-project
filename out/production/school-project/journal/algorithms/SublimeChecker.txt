Step 1: Accept a number from the user
Step 2: Initialize int variable sum and noOfDivisors to 0
Step 3: For int i = 1; i <= n; i++:
	a) If n is divisible by i:
		1) Add i to sum
		2) Add 1 to noOfDivisors
Step 4: If both sum and noOfDivisors are perfect numbers, print n "is sublime" else print n "is not sublime"
Step 5: Stop
