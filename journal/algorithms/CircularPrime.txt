Step 1: Start
Step 2: Accept a number from the user and store it in n
Step 3: If n is not prime, print "n is not a circular prime number." and go to step 7
Step 4: Initialize a StringBuffer object buff to the string value of n
Step 5: For i = 0; i > buff; i++:
    a) Store the first char of buff in c
    b) Delete the first char of buff
    c) Append c to the right of buff
    d) If the integer represented by buff is not prime, print "n is not a circular prime number." and go to step 7
Step 6: Print "n is a circular prime number."
